My name is David and I am a software developer living in Boulder.

In 2016 I decided to change careers and pursue software development instead of continuing a career in finance.  After a 6-month Frontend focused program at the [Turing School](https://turing.io/), I was hired at Canvas Technology in Boulder as employee number 16.

As with any startup, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety challenging problems.  Aside from learning new Front-End technologies, I have added Linux, Jenkins, and Elixir skills.  Additionally, I have been exposed to networking principles and virtual machines.

I am passionate about using technology to improve the work and/or lives of people.
